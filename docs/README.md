## 🎯 Quick Reference

### Common Tasks

**Adding a new page:**
1. Create folder in `src/app/`
2. Add `page.tsx` file
3. Export default component
4. Add navigation link in Header

**Creating a component:**
1. Create `.tsx` file in `src/components/`
2. Define TypeScript interface for props
3. Export default function component
4. Import and use in pages

**Styling with Tailwind:**
- Layout: `flex`, `grid`, `p-4`, `m-2`
- Colors: `bg-blue-500`, `text-gray-600`
- States: `hover:bg-blue-600`, `focus:ring-2`
- Responsive: `md:grid-cols-3`, `lg:text-xl`

**Working with authentication:**
- Check user: `const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()`
- Protect routes: Use layout in `/protected/` folder
- Handle login: Use `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()`

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Daily Development
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Check for errors
npm run lint

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Making Changes
1. **Read the relevant guide** for the area you're working on
2. **Make small changes** and test frequently
3. **Check the browser console** for errors
4. **Use TypeScript** to catch issues early
5. **Test authentication flows** if you change auth-related code

### Before Committing
```bash
# Ensure code builds successfully
npm run build

# Fix any linting issues
npm run lint

# Test key user flows
# - Sign up/login
# - Navigation
# - Core functionality
```
