- **Sample Blog Output**:
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Cloud Analysis: Beautiful Sky Formation",
    "content": "Cumulus clouds identified with fair weather conditions...",
    "author": "CloudWatcher",
    "cloud_types": ["Cumulus", "Stratocumulus"],
    "location": "Temperate mid-latitude"
  }
  ```

### Technical Implementation Details

#### AI Service Architecture
- **Multi-Agent System**: Implemented using Autogen with specialized agents:
  - **Cloud Expert**: Identifies cloud types and formations
  - **Weather Analyst**: Analyzes atmospheric conditions
  - **Location Detective**: Estimates geographic location from visual cues
- **API Flexibility**: Support for OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Grok (placeholder)
- **Image Processing**: Base64 encoding, PIL integration for image handling

#### Database Schema
- **Users**: Authentication, profile data
- **Images**: File storage, analysis results, metadata
- **Blogs**: Generated content, chat history integration
- **Chats**: Session management, message history

#### Testing Infrastructure
- **Interactive Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for testing and demonstration
- **Sample Data**: Example user, cloud photo analysis, blog generation
- **End-to-End Testing**: Complete workflow from image upload to blog creation

### Next Steps

#### Immediate (Completed Today)
- [x] Complete OpenAI API integration
- [x] Set up database models and migrations
- [x] Create example notebooks
- [x] Test with provided cloud image
